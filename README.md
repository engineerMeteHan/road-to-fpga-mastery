# road-to-fpga-mastery
Step-by-step FPGA Learning Journey — from beginner concepts to advanced designs.
This repository documents my personal FPGA learning path, covering everything from 
basic digital logic to complex system designs. Each stage introduces new concepts,
modules, and projects using HDL (VHDL/Verilog) with a hierarchical and practical
approach.

The goal of this repo is to build a solid foundation in FPGA design through structured
examples, experiments, and real-world applications — helping me (and others) grow from 
“Hello, World” blinky LEDs to advanced SoC-level implementations.

Planned Topics / Roadmap 
1. Basic Digital Logic -- gates, fliip-flops, counters, multiplexers
2. HDL Fundamentals -- VHDL & Verilog syntax, testbenches
3. Intermediate Design -- FSMs, serial intefaces
4. Advanced Modules -- moemry controllers, DSP Blocks, timing constraints
5. System-Level Design -- Soc integration, IP Cores, AXI interfaces
6. Real Hardware Demos -- running design on FPGA boards

Tools 
  - Vivade / Quartus / GHDL / ModelSim
  - HDL language: VHDL and Verilog
  - Target platforms: beginner to mid-level FPGA boards (e.g., Basys 3, Nexys A7, or similar)

Purpose
  To share a transparent, incremental learning experience for FPGA development — useful 
  for beginners and hobbyists who want to follow a structured, practical route from zero
  to proficient hardware design.
